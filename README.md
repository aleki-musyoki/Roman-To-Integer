# Roman-To-Integer

This program takes in a roman numeral from the user and returns the corresponding integer value.

Additionally, I have added tests in JUnit5 to check that both valid and invalid inputs have been accounted for and are being handled properly.

The source code for my Main class as well as my Tests class are in the following path 

`src/com/projects/roman`
